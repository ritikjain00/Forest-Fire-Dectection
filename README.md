# Forest-Fire-Detection

In this repo we will talk about Forest Fires detection. Forest Fires pose a threat not only to the forest wealth but also to the entire regime to fauna and flora seriously disturbing the bio-diversity and the ecology and environment of a region. During summer, when there is no rain for months, the forests become littered with dry senescent leaves and twinges, which could burst into flames ignited by the slightest spark.

To solve this problem machine learning plays an important role.ML would help us to predict the chaotic nature of wildfires. ML would help us to identify major fire hotspots and their severity.

I have used Forest fire dataset from kaggle.
